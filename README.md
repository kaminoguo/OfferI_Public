## Overview

**OfferI** is an AI-powered study abroad consultation platform that provides personalized master's program recommendations from a curated database of **100,000+ programs** worldwide.

Unlike traditional consultants charging $2,000-5,000, OfferI delivers professional analysis for **$6 per consultation**, with reports generated in **10-15 minutes**.

### Current Focus

**Master's Programs Only** (MVP Phase)

After validating product-market fit, we plan to expand to:
- Bachelor's programs
- PhD programs (including professor recommendations)
- Non-English taught programs

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technical Advantages

**1. MCP Direct Database Access → Lower Hallucination Rate**

Unlike RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) which uses vector similarity matching, we use **MCP (Model Context Protocol) for direct SQL queries**:

- **RAG Approach**: Text → Embeddings → Vector Search → ~85% semantic accuracy (hallucination risk)
- **Our Approach**: MCP → Direct SQL Query → 100% deterministic results (zero hallucination)

For structured data like university programs (name, tuition, duration), SQL is inherently more reliable than semantic similarity.

**2. Using Official CLI → Product Improves Automatically**

We use **Claude Code CLI** (official tool from Anthropic):

- **Our Advantage**: When Anthropic updates Claude Code, our product gets better automatically
- **LangChain/LangGraph Risk**: Framework abstractions can break with LLM updates, requiring constant maintenance

Using vendor-official tools means we benefit from their improvements without additional engineering work.

## Using Our MCP Server

Our MCP server is available for developers building AI applications with study abroad data.

### Quick Setup

**Step 1: Get API Key**
- Visit https://offeri.org/settings
- Create a free account and generate an API key
- Free tier: 5 MCP queries per month

**Step 2: Add to Claude Code CLI**

```bash
claude mcp add offeri --transport http https://api.offeri.org/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**Step 3: Add to Claude Desktop**

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "offeri": {
      "url": "https://api.offeri.org/mcp",
      "transport": "http",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk_live_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage Example

```
You: Find computer science master's programs in Singapore
     for a student with 3.5 GPA and $50K budget

Claude: [Uses OfferI MCP to query 93,716 programs...]
        Found 12 matching programs in Singapore:
        1. NUS MSc Computer Science - $45K, 1.5 years
        2. NTU MSc AI - $42K, 1 year
        ...
```
