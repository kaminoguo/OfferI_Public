## Overview

**OfferI** is an AI-powered study abroad consultation platform that provides personalized master's program recommendations from a curated database of **60,000+ high-quality programs** from top universities worldwide.

Unlike traditional consultants charging $2,000-5,000, OfferI delivers professional analysis for **$6 per consultation**, with reports generated in **10-15 minutes**.

### Current Focus

**Master's Programs Only** (MVP Phase)

After validating product-market fit, we plan to expand to:
- Bachelor's programs
- PhD programs (including professor recommendations)
- Non-English taught programs

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technical Advantages

**1. MCP Direct Database Access ‚Üí Lower Hallucination Rate**

Unlike RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) which uses vector similarity matching, we use **MCP (Model Context Protocol) for direct SQL queries**:

- **RAG Approach**: Text ‚Üí Embeddings ‚Üí Vector Search ‚Üí ~85% semantic accuracy (hallucination risk)
- **Our Approach**: MCP ‚Üí Direct SQL Query ‚Üí 100% deterministic results (zero hallucination)

For structured data like university programs (name, tuition, duration), SQL is inherently more reliable than semantic similarity.

**2. Using Official CLI Tools ‚Üí Product Improves Automatically**

We use **official CLI tools from major vendors** (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Context7):

- **Our Advantage**: When vendors update their CLIs, our product gets better automatically
- **LangChain/LangGraph Risk**: Framework abstractions can break with LLM updates, requiring constant maintenance
- **Multi-vendor Testing**: We've tested Claude Code CLI, Gemini CLI, and Context7 to ensure flexibility

Using vendor-official tools means we benefit from their improvements without additional engineering work.

## Using Our MCP Server

Our MCP server is available for developers building AI applications with study abroad data.

### Quick Setup

**Step 1: Get API Key**
- Visit https://offeri.org/settings
- Create a free account and generate an API key
- Free tier: 5 consultations per month (one consultation = multiple API calls)

**Step 2: Configure Your MCP Client**

Our MCP server works with any MCP-compatible client. Choose your platform below:

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Desktop</b> - Click to expand</summary>

Edit your config file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "offeri": {
      "url": "https://api.offeri.org/mcp",
      "transport": "http",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk_live_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code CLI</b> - Click to expand</summary>

```bash
# Add OfferI MCP server with your API key
claude mcp add offeri https://api.offeri.org/mcp --transport http -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# Verify connection
claude mcp list
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Gemini CLI</b> - Click to expand</summary>

```bash
# Add OfferI MCP server
gemini mcp add offeri https://api.offeri.org/mcp

# Verify connection
gemini mcp list
```

**Note**: Gemini CLI currently does not support HTTP headers for authentication. Use the free tier (5 consultations/month) or switch to Claude Desktop/Code for authenticated access.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Context7 / Other MCP Clients</b> - Click to expand</summary>

For other MCP-compatible clients, add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "offeri": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.offeri.org/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk_live_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or if your client doesn't support authentication headers, use without the `headers` field for free tier access.
